/// <remarks>
/// A step is driven by breakpoints on the sequence points it may land on rather than by asking the
/// runtime to step one instruction at a time. Without symbols the runtime only knows IL offsets, so
/// a plain step stops in the middle of statements — between the two halves of a comparison, say —
/// while sequence points are statement boundaries by construction.
///
/// The same mechanism is what makes stepping in an <c>async</c> method sane: the frame is inside a
/// generated <c>MoveNext</c>, and the sequence points that body carries belong to the method the user
/// wrote, so F10 walks the user's statements instead of the state machine's plumbing.
