 * The three names each platform goes by, and why they are not the same string:
 * - `runtimeIdentifier` is what the .NET SDK and the DbgShim packages call it (osx, not darwin).
 * - `backendDirectory` is what the main process looks in, `${process.platform}-${process.arch}` —
 *   see `frontend/src/main/backend-client.ts`. Getting this wrong produces a package that starts and
 *   then reports the backend missing, so the two must stay in step.
 * - the electron-builder flags select the installers each platform ships.
